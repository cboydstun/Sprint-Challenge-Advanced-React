- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
    Class components contain state as well as methods.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
    componentWillMount: First, the mounting phase is invoked immediately before the initial render and before React inserts components into the DOM.
    componentDidMount: Next, the mounting phase is invoked immediately after React inserts components into the DOM. 
    componentDidUpdate: Last, after React updates the DOM and is used to interact with the application.

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
    Hooks are used for repeatable scripts and to uphold DRY principles. 

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
    Testing identifies issues that would otherwise take a very long time to track down.
